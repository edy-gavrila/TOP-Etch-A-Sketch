Description: This app simulates something called an etch-a-sketch.
It is a educational project from The Odin project

Project specs:

(*) Pre-requisites: Set up a GitHub repository for the project.

1 (*) The app should have a 16 x 16 grid of square divs
    -The divs should be created in JS
    -The grid of divs should be inside a container div
    - Use CSS Grid as the way to make the divs appear as grid (other ways can be used, I am more confortable with CSS Grid).

Note: In the end, I went for a property of  display: flex for the grid container and a property of flex-wrap set to no-wrap. 

2 (*) Pay attention to borders and margins!
Note: On some grid-size values, the border for the cells is doubled. I suspect there is a rounding error in the calculations for the cell size. I can live with that for the moment. 

3 Use hover effect to change grid cell color when mouse passes over them.
    -for the effect, add a class in JS to the div that is being hovered.

4 (*) Have a button to clear the grid to white when clicked.

5 Have an section to create a new grid with a different number of cells. The user is asked to input the "S" quantity for a S x S grid. The grid overall dimensions should not change for different grid cell numbers.

5 Have a section where the user can choose 2 colors, one base color for the grid background and one for the mouse trace. The mouse trace color can be randomly selected for each cell (rainbow effect).

6 In black and white mode, each mouse pass should add only 10% black to the color, so it takes 10 passes for a cell to be completely black.
